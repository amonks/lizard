# Lizard Illuminati Project // Maurice Hampton | Andrew Monks

We  are making a [crazywall][1] mapping money and power in the ny
art world with the [visual language of the reptilian illuminati][2].
Think polaroids and string and photoshopped gills and lots of ugly text.
You definitely saw me taking [not]stealth pics of all the people we
talked to on the trip.

Hoping to draw some pointed comparisons:

"The locus of power in the [art] world sits with a small group of
wealthy people who exert power behind the scenes [and are alien reptiles
also]."
