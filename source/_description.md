# Lizard Illuminati Project
# Maurice Hampton && Andrew Monks

4% of americans believe in the reptillian illuminati theory, so the next time you're in a room in america with more than 25 people -- odds are one of them believes Barack Obama tastes the air by flicking his tongue in and out.

## what?

We are making a crazywall mapping money and power in the ny art world with the visual language of reptilian illuminati theorists. Think polaroids and string and photoshopped gills and lots of ugly text.

### data

The most substantial part of this project is the actual string-and-thumbtack map. Every person we spoke to or gallery we went to or whatever in NYC is a node. Every connection (collection, representation, exhibition, employment) between nodes is a piece of string.

## why?

Hoping to draw some pointed comparisons:

> The locus of power in the [art] world sits with a small group of wealthy people who exert power behind the scenes [and are alien reptiles also].
