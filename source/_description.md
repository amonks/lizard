4% of americans believe in the reptillian illuminati theory.

The next time you're in a room in america with more than 25 people, odds are that one of them believes Barack Obama tastes the air by flicking his tongue in and out.

We are making a crazywall mapping money and power in the ny art world with the visual language of reptilian illuminati theorists. 

## what?

Think polaroids and string and photoshopped gills and lots of ugly text.

The project will be installed as a string-and-thumbtack crazywall-style map. 

Every person we spoke to or gallery we went to or whatever in NYC is a node, represented as an image or cluster of images.

Every connection (collection, representation, exhibition, employment) between nodes is a piece of string.

## why?

Hoping to draw some pointed comparisons:

> The locus of power in the [art] world sits with a small group of wealthy people who exert power behind the scenes [and are alien reptiles also].
